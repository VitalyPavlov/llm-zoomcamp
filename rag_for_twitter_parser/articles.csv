(Chad Hipolito/Canadian Press)Social SharingThe Canadian men's basketball team learned who their group stage opponents will be at the upcoming FIBA World Cup on Saturday at the official draw in Manila.Canada, who topped their six-country qualification round with 11 wins and one loss, was drawn into Group H, with powerhouse France, Latvia, and Lebanon.The French team plans to have Victor Wembanyama on its roster, who is a consensus No. 1 pick in the upcoming 2023 NBA entry draft.""With France, Lebanon, and Latvia joining us in Group H, each will present a unique set of challenges and varying styles of play,"" Rowan Barrett, Canada's general manager and executive vice-president, said in a release.""Having connected recently with each of our coaches and players, the team remains committed and focused on achieving the goals we've established as a program.""The tournament runs from Aug. 25 through Sept. 10, with group stage games held in in Manila, as well as Jakarta, Indonesia, and Okinawa, Japan.WATCH | Canada books spot in men's World Cup:Canada beats Venezuela to secure spot at FIBA Basketball World Cup2 years agoDuration 0:39The Canadian men's basketball team qualifies for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup with a 94-56 victory over Venezuela in Edmonton.""I'm excited to get back together as a group in August and continue building on a strong performance during the qualifiers,"" Canadian head coach Nick Nurse said.""We've built a challenging exhibition schedule against some of the top federations in the world, which will prepare our team for the tough competition we'll face in Group H and throughout the World Cup.""The four-time defending Olympic champion U.S. team,  who will be coached by Golden State's Steve Kerr in the tournament — were drawn into Group C, with Greece, Jordan, and New Zealand.""To our friends around the world, join our new `Thrilla in Manila,' the 2023 Basketball World Cup edition,"" said Manuel Pangilinan, a FIBA Central Board member from the Philippines — using the phrase coined for the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight in Manila in 1975.The World Cup is FIBA's biggest tournament, plus it serves as a way to qualify for next year's Paris Olympics.With the expectation that France will be added as an automatic qualifier for the Olympics as host — probably no more than a formality, with FIBA not planning to decide until June 30 — there will be seven teams automatically qualifying for berths in the 12-team Olympic tournament.The top two World Cup finishers from Europe and the Americas, as well as one from Africa, Asia and Oceania, will earn berths into Paris 2024.Group DrawAll teams in each group play one another in the opening round.

(Lille is hosting the Games’ basketball group phases, before the City of Lights puts on the knockout rounds).Some have speculated that this early match-up could present the U.S. squad with their toughest individual opponent: Nikola Jokic, a Serbian star who plays for the Denver Nuggets (and a multiple time NBA MVP winner). Notably, the U.S. also faced Serbia for the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro, winning that contest, pretty decisively, by 30 points.How the U.S. does tonight, though, is only an indication of where they’re heading: in the group phase, each team plays three others in their bracket, and will earn two points for a win and one point for a loss (and zero points for a loss by forfeit, interestingly). The two top teams in each group will advance to the quarterfinals (and the start of the knockout round), as will the two best third-place teams overall.The U.S. is part of Group C, including Serbia, Latvia and South Sudan (the young African nation is playing in its first Olympic games; their men’s basketball almost beat the Americans in a warm-up friendly a few weeks ago).The U.S. team is a favorite again this time around, with a stacked team of talent including LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Jrue Holiday, Tyrese Halliburton and Derrick White. They are coached by Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors.Some cool facts about this team: three of its players (Tatum, Holiday, White) play for the Boston Celtics, who just won the 2024 NBA Championships. And four are former MVPs: James, Curry, Durant and Embiid. Durant, in particular, might make history in becoming the Olympics’ first male athlete to win four gold medal in any team sport.More Olympics Coverage from VogueEverything You Need to Know About the 2024 OlympicsThe Best Olympic Uniforms at the Summer 2024 GamesFrom the Archives: Olympians in VogueThe Best Olympic Movies to Watch Ahead of the Paris GamesBefore the Games Begin, Pharrell Williams, Charlize Theron, Serena Williams, Rosalía, and Omar Sy Will Co-Host a Prelude to the OlympicsVogue DailyThe latest in top fashion stories, editor’s picks, and celebrity style.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement (including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Vogue.

The U-S-Avengers arrived when it mattered most to secure gold medals in basketball and soccer. The U.S. and China ran away with 1st and 2nd in the medal count, and both nations finished tied with 40 gold medals each. Who knew Tom Cruise would steal the show at the closing ceremony? The Games look ahead to 2028, and so do we. Let’s close out our Olympic tabs and say 'Au Revoir' to Paris. Letter Rip!   FINAL MEDALS   🏅Click Image for Full Medal Count 6. 🇯🇵 Japan (45 medals)7. 🇮🇹 Italy (40 medals)8. 🇳🇱 Netherlands (34 medals)9. 🇩🇪 Germany (33 medals)10. 🇰🇷 South Korea (32 medals)11. 🇨🇦 Canada (27 medals)12. 🇳🇿 New Zealand (20 medals)13. 🇧🇷 Brazil (20 medals)14. 🇭🇺 Hungary (19 medals)15. 🇪🇸 Spain (18 medals)16. 🇺🇿 Uzbekistan (13 medals)17. 🇮🇷 Iran (12 medals18. 🇺🇦 Ukraine (12 medals)19. 🇸🇪 Sweden (11 medals)20. 🇰🇪 Kenya (11 medals)Full Medal Count   OLYMPICS   🏅Goodbye Paris → Hello HollywoodPhoto: Pool / Getty ImagesTom Cruise Highlights Closing Ceremony as Movie Star Takes Stunt-Filled Trip With Olympic Flag to Los Angeles for 2028 I'll admit the traditions and pageantry of the Olympics are sometimes a bit off the wall. While the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Games featured the first-ever outdoor boat parade and a string of controversies and debates, the closing ceremony was epic. French celebrations aplenty led to a special finale and the tribute to the 2028 Games coming to Los Angeles, USA. Somewhere in between the athletes on the ground and the fireworks in the french sky was Hollywood actor Tom Cruise, performing one of his best roles yet atop Stade de France. The 2028 Los Angeles OlympicsAt the end of Sunday’s closing ceremony, the Olympic flag was lowered and passed to the hosts of the 2028 Games, per tradition. L.A. mayor Karen Bass and U.S. gymnast Simone Biles were the ceremonial recipients. Then this: Cruise dropped Into the stadium ‘Mission Impossible’ style. He secured the flag on a motorcycle and drove through the streets of Paris to a plane in a pre-recorded video, eventually skydiving out into the Hollywood hills. The video featured the Olympic Rings embedded in the two O’s at the end of the 'Hollywood' sign. The tribute ended on the beach with musical performances by L.A.-inspired artists, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, and the star of NBC's Olympics coverage, Snoop Dogg.

All three “favorites” of marquee team events had reached the gold medal games unscathed, and all three finished the job. Women’s soccer (Saturday), men’s basketball (Saturday) and women’s basketball (Sunday) are golden, but all three had to earn it with too-close-for-comfort endings to the Paris Games. The U.S. also swept the 4x400 relays and more events on the track to take a victory lap in the medal count. Let’s rewind the final days of the Olympics. 🏀 MBB: 🇺🇸 USA Clips 🇫🇷 France (98-87) With Curry's 'Golden Daggers'Closer than most! The U.S. men’s basketball team beat France in the gold medal game (98-87) thanks to a second-straight 4th-quarter eruption from Steph Curry (24 points / 8-13, 3pt). It was a three-point game with three minutes to play before Curry hit four straight 3s in crunch time. His last: ""The golden dagger,"" according to NBC's Noah Eagle on the call. Steph hit the ""night night"" celebration and put Paris to bed. Devin Booker (15 pts), Kevin Durant (15 pts), and LeBron James (14-10-6) also helped carry the load in a battle against the rowdy French crowd. France’s Victor Wembanyama (26 pts) and Guershon Yabusele (20 pts) gave the U.S. all they could handle, but it’s the fifth straight gold medal for the USA men’s basketball squad. 🏆 LeBron James Wins FIBA MVP 🏀 WBB: 🇺🇸 USA Rallies to Beat 🇫🇷 France (67-66) & Keep Streak AliveThe U.S. women’s team entered Sunday’s gold medal game on a 60-game win streak dating back to 1992. During that 32-year run, only two opponents played the U.S. to within single digits. No team had them on the ropes like this. France led by 10 points before half as the home crowd roared for what would’ve been an unbelievable upset, but A’ja Wilson and company banded together for a narrow win (67-66). Wilson was the star again with 21 points and 13 boards. Team USA retook the lead with three minutes left and hit 7-of-8 free throws down the stretch. A sliver from silver, but it’s the eighth straight gold medal for the women. 🏆 A’ja Wilson Wins FIBA MVP ⚽️ WSOC: 🇺🇸 USWNT Wins Gold Over 🇧🇷 Brazil (1-0) on Swanson’s StrikeIt’s a gold medal for new manager Emma Hayes in her first summer with the USA! And that trio of young forwards just set the bar sky-high. The U.S. women’s soccer team won each match of the knockout bracket by just one goal en route to the gold medal, taking down Brazil on Saturday (1-0) via the boot of Mallory Swanson (57’). It was Swanson’s team-leading fourth goal of the tournament, but goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher was the MVP. She was magnificent once again with two game-saving stops. Naeher recorded three straight clean sheets in the knockout rounds — all 1-0 victories.

The average rating jumped from approximately 6.9 (entrance) to 8.5 (exit).

Shop now.Let’s take it back to where it all started. Before you learned to play in a full-court setting, you had to get comfortable navigating the half-court. It’s the essence of basketball. From quick pickup games at famous courts like Rucker Park to the shell drill that every formidable basketball team practices, 3×3 basketball is the foundation of the high-flying, up-and-down 5×5 game we’ve grown to love.For the second time in Olympic history, 3×3 basketball will be in full swing as countries compete for a medal, and for the first time in Olympic history, USA Basketball will have a team competing on the men’s side.After winning Gold at the 2023 Pan Am Games and making themselves known on the FIBA 3×3 World Tour circuit, the U.S. 3×3 Men’s National Team automatically qualified for a spot at this year’s Paris Games, entering the field as the No.2 seed.The four-player squad assembled has been playing together for a few years now, and that chemistry will be vital for any success they’re hoping to achieve. But while chemistry and togetherness are keys to Gold, the squad will still need some strong individual performances. Let’s meet the men who make up the first USA 3×3 Men’s Olympic Team in USA Basketball history.There’s nobody better to represent the United States in 3×3 basketball than Jimmer Fredette, one of the nation’s most outstanding college basketball players of all time. He’s a star. He’s box office, and if he’s on your team, you always have a shot at winning. Very few can compete with Jimmer when it comes to putting the ball in the basket. He can catch fire like no other, and his ability to get buckets in bunches will prove valuable in Paris. Name a BYU or Mountain West Conference scoring/shooting record, and there’s a good chance Jimmer holds it. The former NCAA leading scorer and Player of the Year knows that nothing comes easily, although his natural knack for scoring might lead you to think otherwise. Jimmer took the college basketball world by storm when he went on his remarkable individual run at BYU back in 2011. He’ll look to galvanize the country again—this time in pursuit of an Olympic Gold medal and the first in U.S. men’s 3×3 history. Jimmer has earned two Gold medals and one Silver medal in his 3×3 FIBA career, which began in late 2022. This time around, one could argue the stakes are higher than they’ve ever been. If there’s anything you need to know about Jimmer, know this: If you need a bucket, all you have to do is say the word, and it’ll get done.“Defense wins championships.” It’s one of the most used adages in the history of team sports. As basketball continues to lean more and more in favor of offense, having a lockdown defender at your disposal who can offset offensive firepower is as pivotal as ever. That’s what Kareem Maddox brings to USA Basketball’s 3×3 Men’s National Team this summer. The Princeton alum and former Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and All-Ivy League first-team selection (2011) is the squad’s anchor. Along with his defensive prowess, Maddox is a capable scorer with years of professional 3×3 experience, dating back to 2018 when he earned MVP at the USA Basketball 3×3 National Championship. Since then, he’s earned five Gold medals and one Silver during his FIBA 3×3 career.It’s very hard—almost impossible—to win a Gold medal in 3×3 basketball without at least one sharpshooter on the team. Luckily for USA Basketball, shooting is Canyon Barry’s specialty. The 6-6, 215-pound guard is the son of Hall of Famer Rick Barry and is doing his part to carry on the Barry basketball tradition: winning. The younger Barry was a 1000-point scorer in college and averaged 20 points as a junior for Charleston before an injury cut his season short. He transferred to Florida the following season, where he earned 2017 SEC Sixth Man of the Year honors. Canyon is a steady guard who also brings experience to the table and a handful of hardware to show for it. He has four Gold medals and one Silver medal in FIBA 3×3 competition and earned the 2022 FIBA 3×3 AmeriCup MVP. If this year’s 3×3 Men’s National Team has any chance of securing the Gold in Paris, Canyon is going to have to tap into the bag he was in when he helped lead the Florida Gators to the Elite Eight in 2017. And based on the strong performances he’s had on the FIBA 3×3 circuit, there’s no reason to doubt he’ll be ready for the moment when it comes.The last member of the group is Dylan Travis, a graduate of Florida Southern College. Travis is the only player on the 3×3 Men’s National Team who didn’t play at the Division I level, but any real hooper or hoops fan knows how it goes—the best Division II players in the country can compete at any level. As a junior in 2015, Travis led his team to a Division II National Championship before he played professionally overseas for several season. In 2022, Travis made his USA Basketball 3×3 debut, where he instantly made his presence felt. He’s a sniper who can also get to the cup under pressure and cause fits for defenders. Thus far in his FIBA career, he has two Gold medals and one Silver. So far…As the 2024 Games are set to begin, the U.S. has, for the first time, qualified four basketball teams for the Olympics. The newest team, the 3×3 Men’s squad, will no doubt shine as bright as the Olympic flame, right at home on the courts of Paris.SLAM PRESENTS USA BASKETBALL IS AVAILABLE NOWSHOP MAG + TEESPhotos via Getty Images.Trending01Naz Reid Explains His Cult Following, Winning Sixth Man of the Year and Building a Newfound Culture in Minnesota02Extreme Fandom: Uncovering the Mystery Behind StatMuse and the Legion of Muse Accounts That Just Keep Appearing03Caleb Wilson Studied the Legends of the Game, Now He’s Channeling Their Wisdom as He Makes His Own Mark as a Top 10 Player in the Class of 2025You might also likeThe Best of the Best: A Journey Through the USA Women’s National Team’s Historical Dominance Over the YearsBy Michael BradleyJuly 31, 2024Building the Foundation: Luol Deng and Royal Ivey on the Rise of South Sudan’s National Basketball TeamBy Ben OsborneJuly 30, 2024Winning Time: Chronicling the History of USA Basketball’s Men’s National TeamBy Michael BradleyJuly 30, 2024Sign up for the SLAM NewsletterNewsAdvertiseGoodsSubscribe + ArchiveChannelsNewsletterDNATerms Of UseCoversPrivacy PolicyCareersContact Us Follow UsCopyright 2024 © SLAM Media Inc.

But it wasn't an easy road for the U.S. to get here, as the Americans rallied to beat Serbia 95-91 ""in a semifinal classic"" last night. The U.S. faced an 11-point halftime deficit against Serbia -- the ""biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992"" (AP, 8/8). The U.S.-Serbia game was ""another incredible chapter in a tournament already dubbed as the most competitive in Olympic men’s history"" (THE AUSTRALIAN, 8/9). The rematch tomorrow will be ""a wild basketball scene"" (THE ATHLETIC, 8/8). France will be the only Olympic host country besides the U.S. to play in the men’s basketball gold medal game and the first host nation to medal since 1996 in Atlanta. Fans have ""packed Bercy Arena"" during the basketball knockout stages with French fans ""playing drums, jumping to sounds of thumping techno music and unfurling banners that cover up whole sections."" U.S. coach Steve Kerr said of the gold medal game, ""I can’t wait. I think it’s going to be one of the most fun games I’ll ever be part of"" (L.A. TIMES, 8/8). U.S. C Joel Embiid ""continues to be the recipient of catcalls from French fans"" who ""remain irritated by his decision not to play for their country.""

Steph Chambers / POOL / AFP via Getty ImagesBy John E. Gibson7/27/2024Updated: 7/28/2024PrintX 10:00The United States is shooting for what many pundits stateside believe is a sure gold medal in the men’s basketball tournament at the Paris Olympics.And the superstar-filled team’s confidence is on an upward arc. When asked at Friday’s press conference which team he looked most forward to playing at the Olympics, 3-point king Stephen Curry said: “Whoever’s in the gold medal game.”Kevin Durant, sitting next him in the media availability, despite not being healthy enough to work out with the group until Day 1 in Paris, chuckled and said, “Great answer.”The response was excellent, but going into Sunday’s Group C opener against Serbia, the Americans must find great answers for some of their weaknesses.The first is the mileage on some of their legs. Age is nothing but a number, but that figure is high when it comes to the United States. There are seven 30-somethings on a squad of 12.LeBron James throws the average toward the sky at 39 and sharpshooter Curry checks in at 36. But Durant is also 35, Jrue Holiday 34, Anthony Davis 31, and Derrick White and Joel Embiidare both 30 and seen as veterans.Related StoriesAthletes Descend on Paris for Olympic Ceremony7/26/2024Is Team USA Basketball Ready for the Paris Olympics?7/23/2024“We’re all different as we get older,” Durant said. “But the thing about greatness is that you adjust and find ways to continue to be effective, and that’s what LeBron has done at that age.“He’s not running and jumping the same way as he was when he was 25, 26 years old, but he’s still jumping pretty high and running pretty fast. Of course, we’re older players and we’ve got [mileage] on our body, but we figure out ways to be effective, just as Joel has as he’s gone through injuries and gone through his trials throughout the league.“You get up every day, trying to figure out ways to affect the game and your teammates.”Curry chimed in: “You’re going to rely on your younger teammates, too. [It’s a] five-man team.”The U.S. team has other areas of concern besides players who might be slowing down when it comes to chasing around younger, quicker dead-eye shooters. Points allowed in the paint, for instance, was a troubling aspect in a 98–92 warm-up game victory over Australia in mid-July. The Aussies plundered the area down low for 68 points in the loss.Scoring from the center position outside the paint is also an issue in international play for the United States. Davis is a quality midrange shooter from the area near the key and so is Embiidare, but both must find consistency and timing to be productive in those areas. That was a problem at times in the warm-up games.The chemistry experiment is another challenge the Americans need to overcome, having not played together much on the international stage. They turned the ball over 15 times during an exhibition matchup with Canada earlier this month and coughed it up 18 more times in the win over the Aussies.The mixture of stars hasn’t meshed well, and opponents—and their coaches—know that very well.Lebron James, Flagbearer of Team United States, looks on prior to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in Paris on July 26, 2024.  Quinn Rooney/Getty ImagesThere’s so much on the line for the United States as it gets ready to open the tournament—and much of that is on the 3-point line.The National Basketball Association 3-pointer is 23 feet 9 inches. It’s just 22’ 1.75” in international hoops. That requires a subtle adjustment.“You talk about muscle memory, I know where I’m at in relation to the line on NBA courts and you have a certain relation to that and familiarity,” Curry said.“It has been a little different—just when you’re toeing up on the line, you might shoot a couple a little long just because you’re not used to it. But I think we’re passed that, having played five games now, practices and just getting used to the dimensions on the court.”There are also weaknesses that might hurt the Americans on the defensive end. Stopping a team from scoring is a team effort that requires trust, continuity and rotating on time to collectively thwart opponents. Those ingredients are often overlooked.The United States surrendered 100 points in a one-point victory over South Sudan in a 40-minute tune-up game this month. South Sudan, which lost a chance for the upset on the final play of the game, did it in part by sticking 14 shots from beyond the arc.South Sudan’s not necessarily a great 3-point-shooting team, and other opponents might be able to light it up from beyond the arc and force U.S. coach Steve Kerr to adjust his lineup.The United States, though, has it advantages. James—who bailed the Americans out of trouble more than once in the tune-up games—has been a force, there are few who can match up against Davis, Anthony Edwards is an X factor and the talent level from top to bottom is elite.Edwards, said he thinks of himself as the No. 1 guy and Holiday, White and Jayson Tatum are coming of a recent NBA championship run with the Boston Celtics.Still, the United States will have to dig deep to claim gold.Share this articleShare this articleLeave a commentJohn E.

Others listed in the player pool include Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers and Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat, along with two members of the FIBA World Cup squad: Jaren Jackson Jr. of the Memphis Grizzlies and Walker Kessler of the Utah Jazz.Holmgren has had multiple experiences with Team USA, first in 2021 at the FIBA U-19 World Cup and again last summer while working with the select team that was assembled to help the senior national team prepare for games at the 2023 FIBA World Cup. Holmgren was named the most valuable player of the U-19 event, helping Team USA beat France, led by No. 1 NBA draft pick Victor Wembanyama, for the gold medal.The 7-foot-1 Holmgren and 7-foot-3 Wembanyama are thought to be the two front-runners for the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Holmgren  is averaging 17.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 2.5 blocks per game for Oklahoma City, which sits No. 2 in the Western Conference with a record of 29-13.The Spokesman-Review NewspaperLocal journalism is essential.Give directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

Jayson Tatum was neither.And when Day 1 was over, Team USA coach Steve Kerr made a pronouncement so potentially shocking to one of the 12 stars on the American men’s Olympic team that a replacement may be needed.“This is not 1992 — Steph (Curry) and I are not going to be like (Dream Team coach) Chuck Daly and Michael (Jordan), we’re not playing golf every day,” Kerr said.AdvertisementNo, no, USA won’t actually need to swap Curry out for someone less enthused about golf. He can spare a summer. Curry, an avid, scratch golfer who normally would be preparing for the American Century celebrity tournament he won last summer, is part of the team that assembled and practiced for the first time Saturday at the University of Las Vegas in preparation for the Paris Olympics, where Team USA will try to win a gold medal for the fifth consecutive Games.This is arguably the most talented men’s basketball team ever assembled, with the greatest shooter of all time (Curry), the NBA’s all-time leading scorer (LeBron James), USA Basketball’s all-time leading scorer (Kevin Durant), 11 current All-Stars, two current NBA champions (Tatum and Jrue Holiday), and a staggering array of former champions and past gold medalists.Twelve future Hall of Famers, as Kerr predicted recently. After watching this group work out together for the first time Saturday with the start of training camp (save for Tatum, who will join the Americans for practice Sunday but was busy signing his $314 million contract with the champion Boston Celtics), Kerr’s initial takeaway was simple.Yep, “they’re Hall of Famers.”“It’s remarkable to see the talent in front of me as I’m addressing the team,” Kerr said.

Sign upBuyThe comparisons to the 1992 Dream Team — the first American Olympic team with NBA players, led by the best and most famous players of the times, like Jordan, Charles Barkley, and Larry Bird — have come fast and furious since Kerr’s squad was announced last spring. But in the team meeting Friday night, and in film sessions Saturday, Kerr and his coaching staff used the time to show the current stars clips of opponents shoving USA Basketball around at the World Cup last summer, and in competitions prior.AdvertisementWhile only two players on the current roster — Tyrese Haliburton and Anthony Edwards — were part of the American team that finished fourth at the World Cup, Durant, Tatum, Devin Booker, Holiday, and Bam Adebayo were all on the Tokyo Olympic team that lost its first game to France, was nearly eliminated from the tournament, and eked out a gold medal over the French.For years, each USA men’s team has been warned how the rest of the world has caught up. If they didn’t believe their coaches years ago, a combination of the global stars emerging as MVP candidates in the NBA and the numerous losses USAB has suffered from 2019 to now, have proved the point.Which is why Kerr and Curry have work to do, and not so much golf to play.“Chuck and Michael had a great time together on game days, playing 36 (holes),” Kerr said. “Those days are long gone. We have our hands full, despite the amazing roster we have.”“It’s remarkable to see the talent in front of me as I’m addressing the team,” head coach Steve Kerr says. Team USA is vying for its fifth straight Olympic gold medal. (Steve Marcus / AP)Kerr said the first day of practice included “controlled” scrimmages with numerous lineup combinations. Speaking of those, after James finished his remarks to reporters Saturday, and made his way through the throng of reporters toward the exit, he turned to The Athletic and said, “Off the bench — have you lost your mind?” — a light-hearted reference to a hypothetical lineup this outlet described in Friday’s training camp preview in which James was not among the starting 5, because of defense.Kerr could play James, Durant, Curry, and Joel Embiid (a two-time NBA scoring champ) together. In that scenario, there would be multiple guessing games in play, with opponents trying to determine who, if anyone, they could possibly double-team, while the Americans try to figure out whom to guard.They could, for a change, play Embiid and Anthony Davis, two essentially 7-footers (Davis is listed at 6-10 but has incredible reach and plays big), with James (who is 6-8) and Durant (6-11) and Tatum (6-8) on the floor in easily the biggest lineup the Americans have ever featured.Or Kerr could move Holiday, probably the best defender as a guard in the NBA, into that lineup next to Leonard, who when healthy is a top overall defender in the league. Bam Adebayo is a perennial NBA All-Defense honoree who started every game in the previous Olympics. Where will he fit?AdvertisementMaybe Haliburton, one of the best passers in the league; Edwards, who is being eyed as an heir apparent to the aging American stars; and Devin Booker, one of the top scorers in the league, can just stand on the side and play pickleball. (That’s a joke — any one of them could win a close game for Team USA.)“You can feel the greatness in the room,” Holiday said.NBA Champion Jrue Holiday checkin' in.🇺🇸 #USABMNT pic.twitter.com/T2NHMJbfHC— USA Basketball (@usabasketball) July 6, 2024Embiid has never played internationally, not in an Olympics or a World Cup. Born in Cameroon and a French citizen who received his French passport on the promise (perceived promise, if you ask Embiid, or assurance, if you ask French officials) that he would play for Les Bleus, Embiid said his participation this summer was about more than which country he chose to represent. He said it was about “the dream” of being an Olympian — a quadrennial event that was huge in Embiid’s house growing up.If the French crowds boo him during the Olympics, Embiid said, so be it.“I don’t think it should be anything, but if it’s more than that, I embrace it,” Embiid said. “I don’t think you can get worse than playing in New York in the playoffs.”Holiday can become the only male basketball player to win two NBA Finals and two Olympic golds in the same summer. Durant can become the first male to win four golds in men’s basketball.Leonard, like Embiid, has never played internationally, and this is the first Olympics for Curry, who otherwise played in two World Cups.James and Davis haven’t played in an Olympics since 2012 — which was Durant’s first Games and Kobe Bryant’s last.Most iterations of Team USA since 1992 have had staggering amounts of star power, but none quite like this. And that was the initial takeaway from Day 1 of camp — with three weeks of practices, friendlies, trips to the Middle East and to London, and then six crucial, potentially stressful, Olympic games in two French cities (Lille and Paris) to follow.Advertisement“Moving around — that’s what’s stood out the most to me,” Durant said. “You see these dudes and you compete against them, and some of these dudes you probably don’t like during the regular season. And then you get with them and you see who they are as people, see their approach to the game. It’s inspiring to be around.”GO DEEPERLeBron James off Team USA's bench?
