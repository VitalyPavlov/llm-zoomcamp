  <p>Si Woo Kim is on another level at the Presidents Cup as he adds to his lore by recreating the iconic Steph Curry celebration. </p> <p id=""beQn19"">Si Woo Kim is a national treasure and is absolutely dynamite on the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/28/24256418/presidents-cup-3-takeaways-day-2-international-team-sweeps-americans"">International Team</a>. His energy this week at <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/28/24256596/presidents-cup-iconic-photos-quotes-day-2"">the Presidents Cup</a> is iconic.</p>
<p id=""RZFEKj"">During the Saturday afternoon foursomes session, he holed out on the 17th to extend the match against Patrick Cantlay and <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/26/24255403/presidents-cup-xander-schauffele-clutch-closes-out"">Xander Schauffele</a>. However, they still lost the match as the Americans won at 1UP when Cantlay sank a 16-footer for birdie on 18.</p>
<p id=""yNyC86"">After the ball entered the hole, Kim made the sleeping action with his hands, echoing what Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry did at the 2024 Paris <a href=""http://sbnation.com/olympics"">Olympics</a> this past summer.</p>
<p id=""7mpt3X"">“That’s what we needed. I didn’t expect the ball to go in, but I was so excited,” Kim said after the match. “My favorite NBA player is Steph Curry, so that’s what I did. It didn’t finish well, but yeah, I was excited.”</p>

The Canadians played so well, with Hughes providing heroic shot after heroic shot on the back nine, but they could not get the job done—a devastating blow to the fans in Montreal.</p>
<p id=""aQWTAk"">Then, Scottie Scheffler and Russell Henley stormed back from a 3-down deficit against Hideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im to win 3 &amp; 2. Scheffler and Henley won six of the last 10 holes to win.</p>
<p id=""SYVrcv"">Nevertheless, the Internationals salvaged a point in the afternoon Foursomes as <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/25/24254491/pga-tour-presidents-cup-adam-scott-international-team-strongest-ever"">Adam Scott</a> and Taylor Pendrith defeated Brian Harman and Max Homa.

<p id=""VGUI9D"">So now the Internationals face a four-point deficit, 11-to-7, going into Sunday Singles. The Americans have historically played better mano y mano.

  <p>Before things got underway in Auburn-Oklahoma, one Sooner took perhaps the hit of the game</p> <p id=""N076E5"">Oklahoma traveled to Auburn for their first-ever road game as an SEC team, to take on the Tigers. The Sooners are 3-1 on the season, but their year in the SEC has gotten off to a rocky start. The game between Auburn and Oklahoma comes after the Sooners lost their first-ever SEC conference game a week ago, 25-15 to Tennessee.</p>
<p id=""tHlNxO"">Things were rough for Oklahoma — at least one player in particular — before the game even began.</p>
<p id=""GTbt9L"">As the Sooners were taking the field, an Auburn cheerleader was finishing off a tumble routine and ended up absolutely obliterating one of the Oklahoma players. An astute fan in the stands captured the entire thing on video:</p>
