  <p>Tyrrell Hatton’s big win paves the way for him to play in more DP World Tour events later this year, thus giving him a Ryder Cup lifeline.</p> <p id=""PgsmXn""><a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/10/6/24263548/tyrrell-hatton-st-andrews-history-wins-dunhill-links"">Tyrrell Hatton won at St. Andrews</a> in dramatic fashion, making a birdie on the 18th hole to eclipse Nicolas Colsaerts by a stroke.</p>
<p id=""tYy3a7"">But his historic victory on The Old Course also gives him a <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/ryder-cup-golf"">Ryder Cup</a> lifeline. He now has amassed enough DP World Tour points to play in the final two events of the season, the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. The top 70 players qualify for Abu Dhabi, while the top 50 advance to Dubai. They are also Rolex Series Events, where the DP World Tour awards 2,000 Ryder Cup points to players in those fields. Only 1,000 points are up for grabs at regular DP World Tour events, such as this week’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.</p>
<p id=""hMTygo"">“I’m so happy I’ve got my place booked in Dubai,” Hatton said.</p>
<p id=""TpMvg5"">“When I teed off last week at the Spanish Open, I knew that I needed probably at least a second to have a chance. Actually, I was meant to be going to Fitzy’s wedding the week in [Andalucía Masters], and I messaged him a few weeks ago, and I was like, if I don’t have enough points, I might not be able to go, and I felt so bad about that. I guess having a little extra motivation to play well.</p>
<p id=""8P8BJ2"">Due to his <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/1/29/24054241/tyrell-hatton-liv-golf-63-million-join-jon-rahm"">affiliation with LIV Golf</a>, Hatton did not have the necessary points to qualify for the final two events of the season. But that all changed this week with his win.</p>
<p id=""YeEBfo"">He began the season by playing in the Hero Dubai Desert Classic in January but then jumped to LIV. </p>
<p id=""D3laPH""><a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/1/24233573/dp-world-tour-tyrrell-hatton-falters-niklas-norgaard-wins"">Hatton returned to the DP World Tour</a> in August, playing in the Betfried British Masters, where he tied for 18th. He then tied for 10th at last week’s Spanish Open, thus earning even more valuable points. Even though he now plays for the Saudi-backed circuit, Hatton did not rescind his DP World Tour membership and is therefore obligated to play in at least four events per season. But his win at St. Andrews marked his fourth event of the year, as he leaped up to 16th in the Race to Dubai standings. </p>
<p id=""6H23nA"">Now he can attend Matt Fitzpatrick’s wedding without any stress, knowing he has his spot secured in the Middle East. But he can rest easy since he also earned valuable Ryder Cup points. He now ranks fifth among the European team, sitting behind only Rasmus Højgaard, Rory McIlroy, Matt Wallace, and Niklas Nørgaard. Hatton’s hopes of making it to <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/2024/10/2/24260233/ryder-cup-5-things-learned-bethpage-black"">Bethpage Black</a> are now alive and then some. </p>

  <p>Halloween is right around the corner! Here are three golf costumes to look like your favorite PGA Tour and LPGA golfer.</p> <p id=""sDl8lU"">Halloween is just a few weeks away, so it is time to decide on your PGA Tour or LPGA golf costumes. </p>
<p id=""1NfV05"">There are plenty of options this year, including the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2023/10/28/23935216/pga-tour-6-golf-halloween-costumes"">golf costumes we suggested in 2023</a>. Those choices are still relevant and will be received immediately. </p>
<p id=""mrJK5k"">However, a few moments from this 2024 season are perfect to recreate at your Halloween party. </p>
<p id=""tEisjo"">Halloween is a perfect time to express yourself with a fun costume. Why not make it golf-related?</p>
<p id=""OgGuur"">From the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/17/24246604/solheim-cup-team-usa-numbers-evaluating-epic-performance"">Solheim Cup</a> and <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/30/24258394/presidents-cup-us-win-closer-appeared-mind-boggling-stat"">Presidents Cup</a> to the major championships, there are so many things to recreate that your friends will love. What moments could you recreate from the 2024 season? </p>
<p id=""RyeSn7"">So, we picked out three costumes that would be excellent choices for the 2024 spooky season. Let's examine them.</p>
<h2 id=""nGJ8Xl""><strong>3. LIV Golf Bot</strong></h2>
<p id=""Xak0KX"">A <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/liv-golf"">LIV Golf</a> bot usually makes a burner account on X, formerly known as Twitter, to troll PGA Tour loyalists. They love to judge any and everything that the PGA Tour does not do while bragging about what LIV Golf does. These people love the game but do not like the PGA Tour product — they like golf, but louder. </p>
<p id=""9Sph7S"">To make this happen, you could dress in all silver like a robot and create a sign that lets people know your <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/25/24254003/liv-golf-colossal-amount-money-won-2024"">LIV Golf</a> bot handle for social media. Then, throughout the night, comment on how great LIV is and judge the Tour. Bonus points if you dress the robot up in All LIV Golf attire from the various teams.</p>
<p id=""AcRoLU"">It is a fun way to let people know you are a member of golf Twitter and to have fun trolling. </p>

<h2 id=""iBuJ71""><strong>2. Recreate Jason Day’s Masters Vest outfit</strong></h2>
<p id=""7ko8F2"">Another option is to dress like <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/4/12/24128326/jason-day-masters-outfits-talk-augusta-national"">Jason Day at the Masters</a>. No, you do not need to buy the expensive vest at Malbon Golf, but you can recreate it with some DIY. Get a blank vest and print some bold championship logo onto it. Someone could even take fabric paint and make your own logo. Make sure it is bold and big enough to be in everyone’s face.</p>
<p id=""TJWUAq"">You could also buy a cheaper but just as loud vest to mimic this moment that took over golf social media in April. A vintage vest would also be an excellent choice to recreate this look. There are plenty of options at the Goodwill or thrift stores.</p>
<p id=""NYXrom"">Pair the vest with baggy black pants and a black hat, which you can also DIY by putting his logos on it or drawing MOTIVE on the front. Do not forget the shades either, because those will pull it all together and complete the outfit.</p>
<p id=""2Xjlev"">Have fun with it and talk with an Australian accent; people will get it immediately.</p>

  </figure>
<h2 id=""s5MYZ3""><strong>1. Charley Hull’s Iconic Cigarette moment</strong></h2>
<p id=""7ppVjo"">Lastly, it would be hilarious to see people recreate <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/7/1/24189962/lpga-charley-hulls-latest-viral-moment-club-twirl"">Charley Hull</a> smoking a cigarette on the golf course. The world lost its mind when it saw Hull smoking a dart and signing autographs.</p>
<p id=""tzyyPc"">It continues to be one of the things people talk about because she rolled with it. </p>
<div id=""ZTWNHs"">
<blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"">

</div>
<p id=""sSpMjR"">So, to recreate, get a blue windbreaker and recreate the Malbon logo, wear a white hat, buy a pack of cigarettes, put on your glove, and pretend to smoke. </p>
<p id=""kREPJX"">You could even get a blonde wig to wear to make sure people really know who you are. Do not forget the aviator sunglasses either because those have become a staple for the Englishwoman.</p>
<p id=""iY3MMm""><a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/12/24243183/lpga-solheim-cup-charley-hull-unapologetically-herself"">Hull is unapologetically herself</a>, so channel that attitude if you decide to be her for Halloween. It is one of the easiest costumes this year because you can wear your golf stuff and grab a few essentials to pull it together.</p>
<p id=""XHh6Ck"">Which one will you try out this spooky season? If you do, drop the photos in the comments so we can see the masterpieces.</p>

  <p>Englishman Tyrrell Hatton emerged victorious at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship again, and made history in the process.</p> <p id=""L7iqZE"">One day after <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/10/5/24262796/liv-golf-tyrrell-hatton-st-andrews-course-record"">matching the course record at St. Andrews</a>, Englishman Tyrrell Hatton made even more history at the Home of Golf.</p>
<p id=""Lx7Szv"">He won the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship for a third time, becoming the most accomplished player in the event’s 23-year history. </p>
<p id=""lkj602"">Hatton began the day with a one-shot advantage over Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts and won by the same margin. Colsaerts and Hatton have a close relationship, as Colsaerts served as a vice-captain at the <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/ryder-cup-golf"">Ryder Cup</a> last year. But Hatton’s birdie on the final hole, where he brilliantly <a href=""https://x.com/DPWorldTour/status/1842964772717007188"">navigated the infamous Valley of Sin</a>, proved to be the difference. </p>
<div id=""Fe3zwq"">
<blockquote align=""center"" class=""twitter-tweet"">

</div>
<p id=""biZm4P"">It’s also the first time Hatton’s father, Jeff, who played alongside him in the Pro-Am, witnessed his son conquer the Old Course.</p>
<p id=""mgsrmg"">“It means a lot. And yeah, to do it on the Home of Golf is really special,” Hatton said after.</p>
<p id=""rvBwHb"">“Hard to describe, to be honest. I’m at a loss for words.”</p>
<p id=""xsYb5p"">Yet, nobody could have guessed that this would have come down to the wire, especially since Hatton held a three-shot lead through 12 holes. But he found a fairway bunker left of the 13th fairway and compounded his error by missing a three-footer up on the green. Hatton consequently etched a double-bogey six into his scorecard as his lead dwindled to two. But the Englishman made another bogey on the par-5 14th, thanks to his drive settling in another pot bunker. </p>
<p id=""hjC8iV"">In the blink of an eye, Colsaerts now had a chance. He trailed Hatton by one while standing on the 15th tee. The Belgian then stripped a tee shot down the middle of the fairway and stuck his approach to 10 feet up on the green. He drained the birdie putt, and now he and Hatton sat atop the leaderboard, knotted at 23-under-par.</p>
<p id=""ZPUWB2"">The two Europeans then exchanged pars on the 16th and 17th, setting up a dramatic finish on the 18th. After their drives landed just short of the green, Hatton got up and down while Colsaerts could not.</p>
<p id=""bWybVh"">“To be able to put a couple of good rounds together, get all the way to the end, you know, in a position that I haven’t really been in the last couple of years is quite good, of course,” Colsaerts said.</p>
<p id=""3biuRB"">“When you have not been in a position like this for a while, yeah, you kind of forget how much it grabs you. Yeah, you become a bit anxious, but at the same time, you focus and get really, really tuned in. I was able to hit a few amazing shots down the last couple of holes.”</p>
<p id=""svchHj"">Colsaerts has struggled with his game over the past few years as he saw his <a href=""https://www.owgr.com/playerprofile/nicolas-colsaerts-6893"">Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) plummet to 695th</a> in the world. Gone are the days of him vying for a Ryder Cup spot, which he secured in 2012. He has not played in a major championship since 2018, either. But ‘The Belgian Bomber’ showed some magic this week, which included an albatross during the third round, as he gave Hatton quite the fight. </p>
<p id=""TvQs7k"">In the end, though, the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/6/24/24185054/liv-golf-tyrrell-hatton-win-propel-open-championship-glory"">LIV Golf star</a> hit the right shot when it mattered most, thus etching his name further into the history books. </p>

<p id=""moaEaV"">The Vikings entered Sunday with a one-game lead on the <a href=""https://www.prideofdetroit.com/"">Detroit Lions</a> in the NFC North and are moving into a strong position to claim a playoff berth for the second time in three seasons. However, Minnesota faces a tough history. Teams that win their first five games of the regular season usually make the playoffs, but twice dating back to 2003, the Vikings have blown a strong start.</p>
<p id=""Yd58uF"">The Vikings went 5-0 to start the 2016 season and 6-0 to start the 2003 season, and in both instances failed even to claim a wild card berth. </p>
<p id=""s1Yalu"">They head into a bye following this trip to London and then have what many would consider a fairly light schedule coming out of the bye. They host a tough Lions squad in Week 7, but then travel to face a banged-up Rams squad in Week 8, and then get an AFC South run against the Colts, Jaguars, and Titans, before traveling to Chicago ahead of Thanksgiving. </p>
<p id=""R5tXFg"">They probably won’t be unbeaten after 12 weeks, but they can get quick a few key wins and move closer to a playoff berth.</p>
<p id=""yZHkjg""><a href=""https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/49ers-eagles-join-exclusive-list-of-nfls-5-0-teams-since-1990-what-history-says-about-super-bowl-chances/"">Since 1990</a>, six times (including the two Vikings teams noted above) have started 5-0 and missed the playoffs:</p>
<ul>
<li id=""yhO37c"">1993 <a href=""https://www.canalstreetchronicles.com/"">New Orleans Saints</a> - Finished 8-8</li>
<li id=""kR7f3M"">2003 Minnesota Vikings - Finished 9-7</li>
<li id=""11nYp7"">2009 <a href=""https://www.bigblueview.com/"">New York Giants</a> - Finished 8-8</li>
<li id=""c8SnWF"">2009 <a href=""https://www.milehighreport.com"">Denver Broncos</a> - Finished 8-8</li>
<li id=""LXzLZI"">2015 <a href=""https://www.thefalcoholic.com/"">Atlanta Falcons</a> - Finished 8-8</li>
<li id=""tcnVfL"">2016 Minnesota Vikings - Finished 8-8</li>
</ul>
<p id=""akgwj3"">After sealing their Week 5 victory over the Jets with an interception, the odds are <a href=""https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/nfl?tab=playoffs"">very strong that the Vikings will make the playoffs</a>. If they fail, Minnesota fans might start to hope for an early season loss only to avoid adding to their own history.</p>"

In the circumstances, then, the chequered fate of the ArcelorMittal Orbit – the Anish Kapoor sculpture in east London that like all the best art was named after a global steel conglomerate and fitted with a giant slide against its creator’s wishes – stands as a kind of totemic, even cautionary Olympic tale.</p><p>Officially, the Orbit has been closed since the start of 2024 for maintenance work. In practice, visitor numbers have emerged largely unscathed. Original projections of 350,000 a year were, it turns out, just another of London 2012’s grand numerical fictions. The true figure averages out at about 93,000, which given its steep maintenance costs means London taxpayers are still effectively paying for it.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/10/paris-2024-must-learn-from-london-broken-promises-olympics-paralympics-legacy"">Continue reading...</a>"
