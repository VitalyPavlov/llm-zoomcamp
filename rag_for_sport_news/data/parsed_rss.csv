  <p>The Presidents Cup score sits 5-5 after the Internationals swept the Americans Friday. Let’s look at the best photos and quotes.</p> <p id=""zvOi4s"">Welcome to Playing Through’s daily ritual — Golf Talk Today.</p>
<p id=""hrP0bw"">Each day, the crew will discuss various elements of the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf-pga-tour"">PGA Tour</a>, LPGA, LIV Golf, and more.</p>
<p id=""qpv30R"">Day 2 brought the energy! Before Day 3 begins at <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/27/24256347/presidents-cup-day-3-pairings-internationals-rally"">the Presidents Cup</a>, let's rehash the wild ride from Friday.</p>
<p id=""701IwA""><a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/27/24256265/presidents-cup-hideki-matsuyama-sungjae-im-dominate-history"">The International Team</a> swept the Americans, tying the score 5-5. Whatever pep talk happened on their bus after Thursday’s session worked for the Black and Gold team.</p>
<p id=""nQ4RBC"">They came out with a vengeance and backed into a corner. The Internationals responded in a way that should keep the Americans on their toes. </p>
<p id=""2wQ47P"">This group played like one, and the camaraderie was very noticeable. They came together and proved that <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/26/24254685/presidents-cup-social-media-posts-quotes-usa-international-teams"">the Presidents Cup</a> is a must-watch event.</p>
<p id=""qsMowM"">It is something to behold when the Presidents Cup is close like this. Anyone who pushes this event to the side should check themselves because Friday gave the fans quite the show. The International Team will not lie down this weekend and could very well upset the Americans. </p>
<p id=""XppF7l"">After such a fun day, let’s look at some of our favorite photos and quotes from Day 2 at Royal Montreal. </p>
<h2 id=""b80N1S""><strong>Best photos from Day 2 at the Presidents Cup</strong></h2>
<div id=""1If7h5""><div></div></div>
<p id=""5pQxzZ"">The International Team had some fantastic celebrations on Friday. One of my favorite things I saw was the pure bliss on their faces. However, seeing the somber looks on the Americans was also very telling of what happened during the Friday Foursomes session.</p>
<h2 id=""jBj6T4""><strong>Friday’s best quotes from the Presidents Cup</strong></h2>
<p id=""6sYSxZ"">“I saw all four front groups winning points, so I knew I needed to get points and bring it to the game on. Yeah, we’re game on.”</p>
<p id=""rlDvEe""><strong>— Si Woo Kim on sinking the 15-footer to secure the sweep</strong></p>
<p id=""Rknts8"">“On a day like today, you tip your cap to the guys that played better; in our case, they played better than we did. They were able to use the crowd behind them to their advantage. But we felt the energy right out of the gate. I hit the first tee shot yesterday in our group, and I hit the first tee shot today. It was the night-and-day difference, I think, just the noise and the energy.”</p>
<p id=""bFiiKs""><strong>— Tony Finau on playing against the all-Canadian duo Mackenzie Hughes and Corey Conners</strong></p>
<p id=""HChgfG"">“I like my 11 guys in a dogfight over the next three rounds.”</p>
<p id=""MLtRM7""><strong>— Tony Finau on Team USA’s mentality</strong></p>
<p id=""QhoOWR"">“To come back and show everyone what this team is made of after a tough day out there yesterday is just incredible. We’ve got a big day tomorrow and a bigger day Sunday. We can enjoy this this evening and then come out incredibly focused. This team knows what it’s capable of now.”</p>
<p id=""d9oKst""><strong>— Adam Scott on the International Team’s performance on Friday</strong></p>
<p id=""73ce2S"">“I think the reason we were able to play so good today, other than these guys going out and performing, was our fans backed us up. I think that gives you momentum, that gives you energy. Just they played a huge factor in our win today.”</p>

  <p>Think you can figure out what NFL player we’re talking about? You’ll get five clues to figure him out.</p> <p id=""pILQLT"">We’re back for another day of the SB Nation in-5 daily trivia game, and we’re returning to our system of a new article each day for the game.</p>
<p id=""lzN5iy"">We tried using a single article for the game, updated with the latest game each day, but it was creating a bit of an unwieldy experience in the comments. So, we’ll have the current day’s game plus the previous three days in each new article. That way, you can catch up if you miss a day.</p>
<p id=""eYpvRD"">Game instructions are at the bottom if you’re new to the game!</p>

<p id=""BI2464"">The goal of the game is to guess the correct random NFL player with the help of up to five clues. We’ll mix in <strong>BOTH ACTIVE AND RETIRED PLAYERS</strong> this week. It won’t be easy to figure it out in one or two guesses, but some of you might be able to nail it. It will be a mix of well-known players and some “that guys” that we haven’t thought of in some time. The game will appear in slot #3 of the SB Nation layout each morning, with occasional movement later in the day.</p>
<p id=""UzewZY"">After you correctly guess the player, you can click “Share Results” to share how you did down in the comments and on social media. We won’t go into other details about the game as we’d like your feedback on it. How it plays, what you think of it, the difficulty level, and anything else you can think of that will let us know what you think and how we can improve the game. You can provide feedback in the comments of this article, or you can fill out <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefBRYW5xKK4z-p53VjY4vjcKrBomK1O6hxBVTBUoMUHStH5w/viewform"">this Google Form</a>.</p>
