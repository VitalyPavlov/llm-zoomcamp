<p id=""RZFEKj"">During the Saturday afternoon foursomes session, he holed out on the 17th to extend the match against Patrick Cantlay and <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/26/24255403/presidents-cup-xander-schauffele-clutch-closes-out"">Xander Schauffele</a>. However, they still lost the match as the Americans won at 1UP when Cantlay sank a 16-footer for birdie on 18.</p>
<p id=""yNyC86"">After the ball entered the hole, Kim made the sleeping action with his hands, echoing what Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry did at the 2024 Paris <a href=""http://sbnation.com/olympics"">Olympics</a> this past summer.</p>
<p id=""7mpt3X"">“That’s what we needed. I didn’t expect the ball to go in, but I was so excited,” Kim said after the match. “My favorite NBA player is Steph Curry, so that’s what I did. It didn’t finish well, but yeah, I was excited.”</p>

<p id=""JgxHHT"">He is one of the most iconic members of the International Team. Kim’s competitive nature is what makes watching him so much fun.</p>

<p id=""nrm1kL"">Fans loved that he pulled out the sleeper because Kim is one of the only players who can do that and nail it. </p>

<p id=""tpqJox"">Collin Morikawa and Sam Burns also won their match 1-up, sending <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/27/24256315/presidents-cup-team-usa-bossed-around-canadian-friends"">Mackenzie Hughes and Corey Conners</a> into a state of agony. The Canadians played so well, with Hughes providing heroic shot after heroic shot on the back nine, but they could not get the job done—a devastating blow to the fans in Montreal.</p>
<p id=""aQWTAk"">Then, Scottie Scheffler and Russell Henley stormed back from a 3-down deficit against Hideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im to win 3 &amp; 2. Scheffler and Henley won six of the last 10 holes to win.</p>
<p id=""SYVrcv"">Nevertheless, the Internationals salvaged a point in the afternoon Foursomes as <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/25/24254491/pga-tour-presidents-cup-adam-scott-international-team-strongest-ever"">Adam Scott</a> and Taylor Pendrith defeated Brian Harman and Max Homa. Scott and Pendrith won 2-up on the 17th green.</p>
<p id=""VGUI9D"">So now the Internationals face a four-point deficit, 11-to-7, going into Sunday Singles. The Americans have historically played better mano y mano.

  <p>Before things got underway in Auburn-Oklahoma, one Sooner took perhaps the hit of the game</p> <p id=""N076E5"">Oklahoma traveled to Auburn for their first-ever road game as an SEC team, to take on the Tigers. The Sooners are 3-1 on the season, but their year in the SEC has gotten off to a rocky start. The game between Auburn and Oklahoma comes after the Sooners lost their first-ever SEC conference game a week ago, 25-15 to Tennessee.</p>
<p id=""tHlNxO"">Things were rough for Oklahoma — at least one player in particular — before the game even began.</p>
<p id=""GTbt9L"">As the Sooners were taking the field, an Auburn cheerleader was finishing off a tumble routine and ended up absolutely obliterating one of the Oklahoma players. An astute fan in the stands captured the entire thing on video:</p>

  <p>The wives of Team USA and the International Team have shown out with their fashion choices as they all root on their husbands.</p> <p id=""63sj55"">One of the coolest things about the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/28/24256870/presidents-cup-2024-day-3-afternoon-pairings"">Presidents Cup</a>, <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/ryder-cup-golf"">Ryder Cup</a>, and other team events is that <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/25/24254151/presidents-cup-golfers-wives-impress-photos-opening-gala"">the players' wives</a> are there to show support. </p>
<p id=""PjfQ7f"">Yes, they are at regular PGA Tour events, but it is different for the team tournaments.</p>
<p id=""OXU3PT"">From wearing gorgeous dresses at the opening gala to wearing team colors throughout the event, these wives get their own “team uniforms.” </p>
<p id=""BWbzdx"">Seeing them all matching and following along throughout each session is super cute. </p>
<p id=""J4lWep"">Not everyone focuses on what the ladies are wearing, but of course, I  would. I love seeing what they get from whoever fits the team and how they style it.  </p>
<p id=""gSUfEg"">This year, the outfits are fantastic from both sides.</p>
<p id=""xmNug7"">Let’s take a look at some of my favorites that I have seen from both teams.</p>
<div id=""PEb4m4""><div></div></div>
<p id=""lTVr4p"">On Saturday, the American wives and girlfriends wore USA hockey sweaters. With the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/28/24256418/presidents-cup-3-takeaways-day-2-international-team-sweeps-americans"">Presidents Cup</a> in Canada, it was only right to design team sweaters. They were super cute and not too manly, with a softer feminine touch.</p>
<p id=""unETKf"">Adidas did a great job creating them, and I loved that some of them paired them with puffer vests. I want the vest and the sweater. Not to mention the red-out hat that includes a red flag; it just gives it another pop of color. Some also wore Red, White, and Blue beanie hats, which was a great option. </p>
<div id=""xBvHwm""><div></div></div>
<p id=""JYUGlM"">Look how cute the International wives are in their Nikes, black-and-white socks, skorts, and classic black tops. They are trendy yet completely classic. I love this because I would wear it all. Their gold pom poms are also precious.</p>
<p id=""HnTeCF"">On Friday, the International wives wore super cute khaki sweaters with white polo shirts and another black skirt. It was another classic look that looked fabulous on everyone. </p>
<div id=""WM2HAG""><div></div></div>
<p id=""D1iODF"">The American wives also went with a classic look for Friday. However, it was not my favorite. It looked like an equestrian outfit and felt out of place for a golf tournament. The ladies still looked fabulous, though.</p>
<figure class=""e-image"">

  </figure>
<p id=""LUYG56"">The International wives won me over again with their Day 1 black and white sweater. </p>
<p id=""GwCWRs"">Some fans on social media joked they <a href=""https://x.com/EPatGolf/status/1839318436041863491"">looked like the “Hamburgler,”</a> but this sweater is chic and versatile. However, it was a good joke — I will credit them for it.</p>
<p id=""LZtTrA"">Regardless, this is a chic option and something that looks good on different body types. I  want this sweater in my closet.</p>
<div id=""bJhFvG""><div></div></div>
<p id=""laumeD""> It was also great to see some ladies pair pants with the sweater while others wore skirts. The rainboots with tall socks were a great touch to this outfit. I loved seeing the long socks with the skirts as well, and it was just fun and trendy. </p>
<p id=""WeKB6W"">Some wore the normal baseball cap, while others brought out the bucket hat, which won me over again.</p>
<p id=""XOZAb5"">So far, the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/27/24256238/presidents-cup-golf-fans-reactions-internationals-day-2-dominance"">International Team’s</a> wives have earned the award for best dressed, but one day is left for the Americans to impress.</p>

  <p>Captains Mike Weir and Jim Furyk have revealed their pairings for the Saturday afternoon Foursomes, which should once again produce some drama.</p> <p id=""WHkTGz"">We now have the pairings for Saturday afternoon’s Foursome matches, also known as alternate shot.</p>
<p id=""i8QuCa"">On Friday, the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/27/24256347/presidents-cup-day-3-pairings-internationals-rally"">Internationals dominated Foursomes</a>, sweeping the United States by a remarkable 5-0 score. That sweep came one day after the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/26/24255524/presidents-cup-3-takeaways-day-1-team-usa-5-0"">Americans completed a sweep of their own</a>, winning the opening Fourball session 5-0 on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p id=""CJY8Db"">Then, on Saturday morning, the U.S. bounced back, grabbing an 8-to-6 lead over the Internationals. Scottie Scheffler and Collin Morikawa defeated Adam Scott and Taylor Pendrith 2-up in the opening match. Then, Tony Finau and Xander Schauffele closed out the all-Canadian pairing of <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/27/24256315/presidents-cup-team-usa-bossed-around-canadian-friends"">Mackenzie Hughes and Corey Conners</a> on the 16th hole. Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns closed out Hideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im in the morning’s final match.</p>
<p id=""KBLO4j"">But the most electric atmosphere surrounded Tom Kim and Si Woo Kim’s match. This South Korean duo fed off the Canadian crowd, celebrating their birdie makes as if they had just won the <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/us-open-golf"">U.S. Open</a>. They defeated Keegan Bradley and Wyndham Clark with ease, salvaging a point for the Internationals and winning the team’s first Fourball point in the process. Captain Mike Weir decided to send Kim and Kim out together again this afternoon.</p>
<p id=""uFzCAl"">Yet, remarkably, Weir picked the same eight players who played on Saturday morning to go out on Saturday afternoon. It’s the first time in Presidents Cup history that this has happened, per <a href=""https://x.com/JustinRayGolf/status/1840091815912849668"">Justin Ray</a>. Whether that move pays off or backfires remains to be seen, but leaving Jason Day on the bench for the entire day is a curious decision.</p>
<h2 id=""kyJMwm""><strong>Day 3 Afternoon Pairings — Foursomes:</strong></h2>
<p id=""FGnkDX""><strong>Match 1:</strong> 2:20 p.m. — Scottie Scheffler and Russell Henley (USA) versus Hideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im (Internationals)</p>

  <p>Jon Rahm had some trouble with his driver midway through the third round of the Spanish Open, but it ultimately did not phase him.</p> <p id=""PTna8a""><a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/25/24254003/liv-golf-colossal-amount-money-won-2024"">Jon Rahm</a> had issues with his driver during his third round at the <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2024/9/11/24242024/jon-rahm-ryder-cup-jeopardy-dp-world-tour-pay-fines"">DP World Tour’s Spanish Open</a> in Madrid. It required repairs early on, so he had to go without it until the 14th hole. </p>
<p id=""JVUIov"">But Rahm was unphased by this setback, saying it “didn’t really affect me too much.” Instead, he piped his 3-wood off the tees and paraded around the Club de Campo Villa de Madrid, posting a 6-under 65. He had zero bogies and six birdies and now trails his countryman Angel Hidalgo by two through 54 holes.</p>
<p id=""vn0FLw"">“At the end of the day on this course, if you put it in the fairway, you’re always going to be better than hitting the driver offline. Did a pretty good job mitigating that,” Rahm said.</p>
<p id=""bZem0Q"">“But I was happy to get the driver as quickly back as I did. I just assumed I would play the rest of the round without it. I was happy to hear the news on 12 that I would have it by 14. I think it might have been what — I don’t know, just a little moment of happiness that gave me a little boost for the rest of the round.”</p>

<p id=""LopUhW"">When Rahm received his driver on the 14th hole, he was already 4-under for his round. But he added two more birdies on the 16th and <a href=""https://x.com/DPWorldTour/status/1840056679238435313"">18th holes</a> to climb the leaderboard further. </p>
<p id=""DU7g74"">Now he will head into Sunday’s final round looking for his fourth Spanish Open title, which would surpass the three wins that <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2023/9/29/23895712/ryder-cup-seve-ballesteros-killer-8-word-message"">Seve Ballesteros</a>—his idol—won during his illustrious career. A victory would mean the world to Rahm and Spanish golf as a whole.</p>
<p id=""ve4BpT"">Better yet, Rahm will be joined in the final pairing on Sunday by Hidalgo and David Puig, the 22-year-old Spaniard who left <a href=""https://www.houseofsparky.com"">Arizona State</a> to join LIV Golf in 2022. </p>
<p id=""8Ufsc8"">“I’m very excited. I have yet to be paired with them on any tour or tournament. We play a lot at home, but it just hasn’t happened yet. I’m glad that our first time is going to be here in the final round and final group,” Rahm said.</p>
<p id=""BIxND7"">“And hopefully, I can end up with the win, but it’s definitely going to be a Sunday atmosphere-wise that they haven’t experienced yet. There’s going to be a lot of people watching, and it’s going to be a lot of fun.”</p>

  <p>Augusta National Chairman Fred Ridley released a statement on Saturday morning regarding Hurricane Helene. His focus is on the community.</p> <p id=""vcfS25""><a href=""https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-09-26-hurricane-helene-forecast-landfall-florida-southeast"">Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend</a> region as a powerful Category 4 storm, impacting millions across the southeastern United States. Over the last 48 hours, it has left devasting impacts in the Florida Panhandle, Georgia, and the Carolinas.</p>
<p id=""nMJuk6"">That also includes Augusta, which saw wind gusts of up to 80 miles per hour at its local airport. First responders in the city reported numerous trees falling on houses, cars, and power lines. Flooding also wreaked havoc on the area, which led to several fatalities in the region. Nearly 225,000 people are without power, per <a href=""https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/news/local/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-live-blog-augusta-weather-forecast-closures/75389029007/""><em>The Augusta Chronicle</em></a>. The greater metro area encompassing Augusta, Georgia, and Aiken, South Carolina, has a population of about 600,000, meaning more than a third of the residents in this area have lost power.</p>
<p id=""GZKqlW"">Nearly 1.1 million residents in Georgia are without power overall. Gas shortages have also led to massive lines at gas stations.</p>
<p id=""OAj41A"">Hence, <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/the-masters-golf-augusta-national"">Augusta National</a> Chairman Fred Ridley released a statement on early Saturday morning related to this storm:</p>
<p id=""JemPsR"">“Our Augusta community has suffered catastrophic and historic impact from Hurricane Helene. We currently are assessing the effects at Augusta National Golf Club,” Ridley said in the statement.</p>
<p id=""P1LFnA"">“In the meantime, our focus and efforts are foremost with our staff, neighbors, and business owners in Augusta. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as well as everyone throughout Georgia and the Southeast who have been affected.” </p>

</blockquote>


</div>
<p id=""7BO9rA"">Ridley did not mention any damage to the club’s property; instead, he focused on the community. The club has maintained a philanthropic presence in Augusta for years, supporting local charities and endeavors annually through its Masters Tournament Foundation. The club also provided the <a href=""https://bgcgreateraugusta.org/the-hub#:~:text=Augusta%20National%20and%20the%20Community,United%20Way%20of%20the%20CSRA."">Boys and Girls Club of Augusta</a> with a $2.5 million gift that helped build a community center, which opened in 2022.</p>
<p id=""ae6hDw"">But now the region faces devastating impacts that could take months—perhaps years—to clean up and repair. Yet, Augusta National will be at the forefront of those efforts, lending a hand to its community, which is desperately in need. Whether the course and club suffered any damage is unknown, but that is clearly not the priority.</p>

<aside id=""X7EUiN""><div></div></aside><p id=""sALSa1"">Second reaction? It’s so strange to see two teams contending to win their conference make player-for-player trades with each other, seemingly motivated more by finances for one side.

<p id=""zl7Klo"">For the Knicks, it appears they are all-in to pay any price to bring New York a title around Jalen Brunson’s <a href=""https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2024/7/12/24197522/jalen-brunson-contract-extension-knicks-discount-salary"">unprecedented contract sacrifice</a>. Once they get past any sad feelings about losing one of their Villanova infinity stones, Towns gives them exactly the sort of spacing, offensively skilled big that could take their offense up a level to break through in the Eastern Conference. He’s certainly an expensive final piece, but he’s also one that could be massively overqualified for the role New York needs from him. And as last year’s historically expensive and deep <a href=""https://www.celticsblog.com"">Boston Celtics</a> team showed, when an organization is loading up to make a run at a title, they can’t pinch pennies. At least on first glance, it would appear New York knows that, and that it’s a secondary priority for Minnesota.</p>

The unprecedented loss total will be one. The incomprehensibly bad performance of the team’s position players will be another. The <em>three separate </em>losing streaks of 21, 14, and 12 games.

What if he had stayed more than a single season at Arsenal? What if he hadn’t made the catastrophic decision to leave Real Madrid and La Liga for Anzhi Makhachkala and the Russian league?

Diarra was set to remain a footnote in the history of some prestigious clubs, a series of unanswered questions, something of an enigma – but then we have a legal case, which will finally be settled on 4 October, putting the final full stop to a story that has been dragging on for a decade. It is Diarra v Fifa and if the player wins it could completely change the transfer market, possibly leading to anarchy.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/29/will-the-lassana-diarra-case-bring-down-transfer-market-as-we-know-it"">Continue reading...</a>"

But if his mission this season is to improve a little on every equivalent fixture from the last campaign, this was the easy bit. A 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace in May was probably the nadir of a season that had many lows. Saturday’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report"">goalless draw</a> probably does represent progress, but the picture is far from clear.</p><p>United were by far the better side before half-time and, but for the woodwork and Dean Henderson, would have had a comfortable lead; in the game as a whole, Henderson made seven saves with a combined xG of 1.65. There is an alternative universe not very far removed from this one in which United scored with one of their early chances and went on to win just as comfortably as they had at Southampton last week.
